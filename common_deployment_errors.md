# Deployment Error Resolution Summary

## Recent Fixes

1. ESLint Unused Variables
   - Removed unused `CACHE_DURATION` constant from `route.ts`
   - Removed unused `useCallback` import from `LocationSelector.tsx`
   - Removed unused `isBefore` import and `handleUseCurrentLocation` function from `page.tsx`

2. Next.js Route Export Rules
   - Removed `clearCaches` export from API route file
   - Only kept valid Next.js route exports (GET, POST, etc.)

3. TypeScript Interface Consistency
   - Updated `SearchResult` interface to make `state` and `country` required but nullable
   - Made `LocationInfo` interface consistent with actual usage
   - Updated `IPLocationResponse` to match `LocationInfo` interface structure

## Best Practices for Deployable Next.js Code

1. API Routes
   - Only export HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
   - Keep utility functions as non-exported
   - Avoid test-only functions in production code

2. TypeScript Types
   - Be explicit about nullable vs optional properties
   - Use `undefined` instead of optional properties when a field must be present but might not have a value
   - Keep interfaces consistent across related components
   - Document complex type decisions with comments

3. ESLint
   - Regularly check for unused imports and variables
   - Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed
   - Consider using `// @ts-expect-error` or `// @ts-ignore` only as a last resort

4. Code Organization
   - Keep API route files focused on request handling
   - Move utility functions to separate service files
   - Use consistent type definitions across the application

5. Pre-deployment Checklist
   - Run `npm run build` locally before deploying
   - Check for ESLint warnings and errors
   - Verify all API routes follow Next.js conventions
   - Ensure type definitions are consistent
   - Remove any testing or debugging code

6. Common Deployment Issues to Watch For
   - Unused variables and imports
   - Invalid API route exports
   - Inconsistent type definitions
   - Missing required environment variables
   - Incorrect file structure for Next.js conventions
